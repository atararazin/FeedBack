# FeedBack

## About
I developed this web application from scratch using React, Redux, Node.js, and MongoDB. The app sends mass emails to a big list of users for the purpose of collecting feedback. 
It has the ability to login with Google and then view and create new surveys, or buy more credits to do that.
The app was developed in both developement and production environments, the production was deployed to Heroku.
