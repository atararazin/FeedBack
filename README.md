# FeedBack

## About
I developed this web application from scratch using React, Redux, Express, Node.js, and MongoDB. The app sends mass emails to a big list of users for the purpose of collecting feedback. 

This app has a user authentication process using Google OAuth, the ability to receive payments using Stripe's API, and can send mass surveys to customers using SendGrid.
The app was developed in both developement and production environments, the production was deployed to Heroku - https://immense-bastion-34611.herokuapp.com/
